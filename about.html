  <h1>Sup! I'm Michael!</h1><br/><br/>

  <p>I got bored one night and decided that my current website kinda was going nowhere, and why pay for hosting when you can use Github! so yeah....here we are... can I buy you a <a href="http://imgur.com/hKCaP5n">coffee?</a></p>

  <p>I'm a Developer/App Support guy at Holcim, but also get around doing music and pyrotechnic stuff. I also tend to lend a hand to <a href="http://ncss.edu.au">NCSS</a> and <a href="https://groklearning.com/">Grok</a> when I can, and its always fun!</p>

  <p>Because the internet is a big, scary, place... standard disclaimers about these being my views and not my employer's apply.</p>
